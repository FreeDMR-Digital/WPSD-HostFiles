## About These HostFiles

I mirror the official Pi-Star and other canonical hostfiles, etc. here, as to
prevent many users from slamming the official servers, while using my
unofficial Pi-Star fork
([<code>W0CHP-PiStar-Dash</code>](https://w0chp.net/w0chp-pistar-dash/))  `;^)`

These hostfiles are checked for changes, and if there are changes, updated once
per hour at random minutes of each hour.
